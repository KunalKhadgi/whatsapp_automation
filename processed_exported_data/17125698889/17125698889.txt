16/12/2024, 19:42 - realrx: Hi Sunny!Thank you for sending over the agreement—I’m excited to
start collaborating with Root Labs! I just wanted to confirm a
few details to make sure we’re aligned and everything runs
smoothly:1.Payment Timing: Once the 8 videos are posted, is there
a set timeline for when I’ll receive the $500 payment (e.g.,
within 7 days)?2.Commission Terms: I noticed the 30% commission
is subject to change. Could you confirm that any changes will be
communicated in advance or require mutual agreement?...[TRIAL FOR
DEMO]... Videos: Since the videos need to be reviewed before
posting, could you let me know how long the review process
typically takes? This will help me ensure I meet the deadline. 4.
the agreement mentions posting daily. Does this apply only during
the 15-day period to complete the 8 videos, or is there an
expectation to continue posting after that? I want to make sure I’
m aligned with your expectations and can create the best content
possible for the campaign.Looking forward to hearing from you!
