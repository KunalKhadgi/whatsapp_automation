17/12/2024, 03:48 - Chris - Noladadlife: Thank you for sharing the agreement. I’ve reviewed it, and I’d
like to clarify a few key points to ensure this collaboration
works smoothly for both of us:1.Content Ownership: I retain full
ownership of all content I produce. I can grant the brand a
non-exclusive license to use the content for TikTok promotions
for a set period (e.g., 6 months). Any additional usage outside
of TikTok or for paid ads will require further discussion and
compensation.2.Approval Process: I appreciate aligning on brand
goals, but I request creative freedom to post content without
prior approval. This helps maintain efficiency and avoid multiple
revisions while ...[TRIAL FOR DEMO]...ality content.3.Payment
Terms: To secure my time and commitment, I require a 50% deposit
upfront, with the remaining 50% due upon delivery of the content.
Posting and usage rights will only transfer once full payment is
made.4.Commission Structure: For TikTok Shop, I must receive my
standard commission rate on all sales generated, even if the
content is boosted or given ad support. I want to ensure that
performance-based revenue aligns fairly with the effort and
results delivered.Please let me know if we can update the
agreement to reflect these terms. I’m excited about creating
valuable content for you and look forward to working together!
