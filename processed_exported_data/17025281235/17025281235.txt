Could u please send a sample video for your Shilajit gummies too? I have a sample and need to post.

Hook Options:
I grew up with green juice parents, and this is what I’ve learnt
I grew up with an almond mom – and this is what I’ve learnt
I’ve never had chips or soda in my life – but I’m thankful now

Guidelines:
1. Start while casually cutting fruit on camera – keep it real and relaxed.
2. Say something like: “My parents always believed in superfoods and supplements. I barely ever got sick—even COVID didn’t hit me.”
3. Then shift the tone: “But now I see so many friends struggling… low immunity is real.”
4. Share 2 quick health tips that work for you – like warm water in the morning, or daily sunlight.
5. End with: “We’ve always taken these supplements—because of what’s in them. It’s the ingredients that make the difference.”

01/05/2025, 21:46 - Connie: Got it. I am going to do the gummies today since that post is due and will try my hardest to add the roll on serum. I might not stitch Kim today but I’ll do my research and get a video out. Thank you for helping. We will go viral!
